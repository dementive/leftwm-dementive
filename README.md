# Dementive leftwm theme

Simple [leftwm](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) theme with just enough to have a functional system.

The css customizations I use for firefox and a rofi theme are also included.

# Features

1. Small red borders only on focused window.

2. No margins. I don't like wasted space.

3. Cool space background.

# Non-Features

1. Bar - I don't really need a bar.

2. Compositor - I don't really need a compositor.

# Optional Dependencies

There are no dependencies. I currently use these 2 but they are optional and the theme will still work without them.

1. lxsession - This is the session manager im currently using, will replace with something else in the future probably. If you don't want it, just remove it from the up and down scripts.

2. feh - Set the desktop background
