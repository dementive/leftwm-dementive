# Dementive leftwm theme

Simple leftwm theme with just enough to have a functional system.

# Features

1. Small red borders only on focused window.

2. No margins. I don't like wasted space.

3. Cool space background.

# Non-Features

1. Bar - All bars are just eyecandy, why would use a bar when you can just use the terminal?

2. Compositor - More eyecandy that isn't needed.

# Dependencies

1. lxsession - This does some stuff im not exactly sure what but I need it to actually use my computer. Once I figure out an alternative i'll probably remove this.

2. feh - Set the desktop background
