# Dementive leftwm theme

Simple [leftwm](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) theme with just enough to have a functional system.

# Features

1. Small red borders only on focused window.

2. No margins. I don't like wasted space.

3. Cool space background.

4. Simple picom config with shadows and windows that fade when changing workspaces

# Non-Features

1. Bar - I don't really need a bar.

# Optional Dependencies

There are no dependencies. I currently use these 2 but they are optional and the theme will still work without them.

1. lxsession - This is the session manager im currently using, will replace with something else in the future probably. If you don't want it, just remove it from the up and down scripts.

2. feh - Set the desktop background

2. picom - Compositor

# Other themes and configs included

1. alacritty - Dracula based theme

2. config - My config.ron file for leftwm

3. firefox - My firefox css tweaks, see the README in the folder for more info.

4. fish - My fish config

5. gtk - The gtk 3/4 theme that I use.

6. rofi - Minimal dark rofi theme
